#summary Todo list for changing code to namespacing

= Ordering =

  # ~~Put classes in own files.~~
  # ~~Logical directory structuring (see Autoloading).~~
  # ~~Remove any `isset('TUXXEDO') or exit;` lines.~~
  # Change how exceptions are used:
    * Add `use Tuxxedo\Exception;` to head of file.
    * `Tuxxedo_Basic_Exception` = `Exception\Basic`.
    * `Tuxxedo_SQL_Exception` = `Exception\SQL`.
  # Remove references to Tuxxedo superglobal object.
    * Replace with Registry references.
  # Remove index.htmls from directories.
