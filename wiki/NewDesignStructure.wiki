= Why? =

The new folder structure is based upon the idea for bundles.
The structure aims to bring maximum flexebility, for the creator of a bundle to decide what to do.

The current structure has some limtations, in the terms of seperating the core layer from layers above. And it's also head to bring a really god implementation for installing/removing bundles, by script.

{{{
index.php
        /library/
                /Config.php
                /Bundles/
                        /{BundleName}/
                                Config.php
                /Engine/
                        /Design/
                                /Bundle.php
                        Loader.php
                        Registry.php
                        Functions.php
                        Boostrap.php
                        Exception.php

The structure above, is the new proposed structure.
The BUndles folder, should only contain bundle packs, and thier own design structure. While engine, should only contain the bare minimum core features.
